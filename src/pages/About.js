            <p>I have worked on many different types of sites: from templated site-builder sites, e.g. Wordpress or Wix, for the client that wants a website they can manage 
                and update themselves without coming back to me; to websites using JS frameworks like React and Next, or enterpise-level Content Management Systems.
